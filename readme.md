🤟 SignSpeak: Real-Time Sign Language Interpreter
Category: Accessibility, Computer Vision, NLP
Objective:
SignSpeak is an AI-powered system that accurately interprets sign language gestures and converts them into spoken or written conversation in real time. It bridges the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and non-sign language speakers using cutting-edge Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing techniques.

🚀 Features
✋ Real-Time Sign Language Detection
Detects and interprets sign language gestures from live camera feed or pre-recorded videos.

🔄 Gesture-to-Text & Speech Conversion
Converts recognized signs into readable text and clear, synthesized speech.

👥 Dual-Mode Interface
Intuitive UI designed for both the signer and the listener for seamless interaction.

🌐 Multi-Dialect Support
Designed to adapt to variations across regional sign language dialects.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend:html , css JS , Flask

Backend: Python, Flask

Computer Vision: OpenCV, MediaPipe

NLP & Speech: pyttsx3

ML Models: Random Forest Algorithm  Custom Dataset

📸 System Architecture
Input Layer: Live camera/video stream capturing sign gestures
